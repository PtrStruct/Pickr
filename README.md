## Why is this a thing? <a name = "why_document"></a>

- As of right now Windows doens't have a good ColorPicker, besides the one that was shipped with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/">PowerToys</a>
And even that one lacks some features that I personally would love to see.


## FYI <a name = "fyi"></a>

- This repo is NOT backed by Microsoft in any shape or form, this is just a tool that I'm working on that's open-source. I would however love to see this being a part of Windows in the future.
